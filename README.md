What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
- it is where someone can build and train AI and ML models
- key features include:
  1. easy to use
  2. scalable
What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?
- tensor flow uses a static computation graph  while pytorch uses dynamic

What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
- deep learnig library where one can build and train neural newtworks. it runs on tensorflow

What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
- Built in datasets
- wide range of algorithms
- preprocessing tools

What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?
- efficinet coding
- easy debugging

In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
- to prevent overfitting

What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
- Updating model parameters

In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
- Used for image processing

What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
- Tree classifier which is applied to iris dataset

What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
- visualization is like graph which is genereted using matplotlib
